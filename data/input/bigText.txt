A galaxy born just after the cosmic dark ages may be the farthest cosmic object ever spotted, but the true nature of the object remains very much a mystery.
Two new studies, published on April 7, present the case that an astronomical object -- a galaxy -- could be up to 13.5 billion light-years away.
They've dubbed it HD1 and, if confirmed, it would overtake the current record holder: GN-z11, a galaxy that sits about 13.39 billion light-years away.
HD1 was discovered with the help of a number of space- and ground-based telescopes, including NASA's Spitzer and Japan's Subaru telescope, 
situated at Hawaii's Mauna Kea Observatory. Yuichi Harikane, an astronomer at the University of Tokyo and lead author on one of the new studies, 
said the team searched among more than 700,000 objects to find HD1. He noted it was a surprising find that gave him goosebumps.
The galaxy appears super bright in UV and gives astronomers some clues about what is happening. The teams present two theories.
The first is that HD1 is a superpowered starburst galaxy. It could be so bright because it's producing stars at about 10 times the rate than expected 
for a traditional starburst galaxy and those stars might even be some of the earliest stars in the universe. They're known to shine brightly compared 
to other stars.
"If we assume the stars produced in HD1 are these first, or Population III, stars, then its properties could be explained more easily," 
said Fabio Pacucci, an astronomer at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian and lead author on one of the studies.
Alternatively, it might be a supermassive black hole feasting on gas and dust -- a violent process that creates a huge amount of light.
